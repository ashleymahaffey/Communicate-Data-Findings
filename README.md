# Communicate-Data-Findings
This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process.

In Part I, Exploratory data visualization, Python visualization libraries is used to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables.

In Part II, Explanatory data visualization, a short presentation illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that were discovered in the selected dataset. The primary method of conveying findings is through transforming exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.

This project uses Python 3 and completed through the Jupyter Notebooks IDE. Anaconda distribution was used to install Python, since the distribution includes all necessary Python libraries as well as Jupyter Notebooks. The following libraries are used in this project:

- NumPy
- pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
