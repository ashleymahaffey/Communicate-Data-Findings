## Prosper Loans Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis consists of loan data from Prosper, a peer-to-peer lending platform. It includes information such as borrower APR, credit grades, loan terms, and other relevant features. The data was sourced from [Loan Data from Prosper (82.5 MB)] and underwent preprocessing to handle missing values and ensure data quality.

## Summary of Findings

Our data exploration revealed several insights into the factors influencing borrower APR in Prosper loans. Notably, there is a strong negative correlation between credit grade and APR, indicating the significance of creditworthiness. The relationship between loan amount and APR is complex, with non-linear patterns emerging. These findings form the basis for further analysis and modeling.

## Key Insights for Presentation

In the explanatory presentation, we plan to focus on illustrating the impact of credit grade on borrower APR, emphasizing the non-linear dynamics with loan amounts, and the relationship between loan status and APR variations. The visualizations will be refined to clearly convey these relationships, and additional charts may be introduced to enhance the narrative. The presentation aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors shaping borrower APR in Prosper loans.
